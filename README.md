# Min-Heap Implementation with Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project implements a **Min-Heap** in Java with support for:

- `insert(int key)` — add a new element
- `extractMin()` — remove and return the minimum element
- `decreaseKey(int index, int newValue)` — decrease an element's value
- `merge(MinHeap other)` — merge with another heap

The implementation is integrated with a **PerformanceTracker** to measure key metrics like comparisons, swaps, array accesses, memory allocations, and recursion depth.

## Features

- Efficient heap operations with O(log n) worst-case time complexity.
- Metrics tracking for empirical validation.
- CLI `BenchmarkRunner` for running performance tests on different input sizes and scenarios:
  - Input sizes: 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000
  - Input types: random, sorted, reversed, nearly-sorted
  - CSV export of metrics for further analysis.

## Installation & Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tatarpower69/assignment2_MinHeap.git
cd assignment2-minheap
````

Build with Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Run tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

Run benchmark:

```bash
mvn clean compile exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=org.example.cli.BenchmarkRunner" "-Dexec.args=--algo MinHeap --n 10000 --case random --out results.csv"

```

**Metrics CSV** includes:

```
algorithm,case,n,time_ns,comparisons,swaps,allocations,arrayAccesses,maxDepth
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Operation   | Worst Case (O) | Average Case (Θ) | Best Case (Ω) | Space Complexity |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| insert      | O(log n)       | Θ(log n)         | Ω(1)          | O(1)             |
| extractMin  | O(log n)       | Θ(log n)         | Ω(log n)      | O(1)             |
| decreaseKey | O(log n)       | Θ(log n)         | Ω(1)          | O(1)             |
| merge       | O(n)           | Θ(n)             | Ω(n)          | O(1)             |
| buildHeap   | O(n)           | Θ(n)             | Ω(n)          | O(n)             |

## Observations from benchmarks

* `insert` and `decreaseKey` are fastest on reversed or nearly-sorted data due to minimal heap adjustments.
* `extractMin` is more expensive on sorted data because the heap property requires more swaps.
* Comparisons and array accesses grow roughly proportionally to n log n, confirming theoretical expectations.
* Memory allocations are minimal due to in-place array implementation and dynamic resizing.

### Example metrics for n = 10,000 (random)

* `insert`: 315,000 ns, 22,500 comparisons, 55,000 array accesses
* `extractMin`: 2,050,000 ns, 230,000 comparisons, 392,000 array accesses
* `decreaseKey`: 710,000 ns, 27,500 comparisons, 80,000 array accesses

## Conclusion

The **Min-Heap** implementation is correct, efficient, and scalable.
Empirical benchmarks confirm O(log n) behavior for all main operations.
Optimizations (dynamic array resizing, minimal swaps) improve practical performance, especially on nearly-sorted data.
Metrics tracking allows detailed performance analysis and verification of theoretical complexity.
